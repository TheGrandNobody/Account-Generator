# Ethereum Wallet Generator
This script generates a .csv file called "accounts.csv" containing a given number of ECDSA private keys and their associated Ethereum addresses. The private keys are generated using a cryptographically-secure pseudo random generator. 

## How to use this generator
In order to use it, you simply need to open your terminal run the script with the number of accounts you wish to create. For example, someone who wants to generate 10 accounts will type a command which would look like:
```
python generator.py 10
```
